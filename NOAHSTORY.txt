One of the biggest events 
in my life would have
to be the birth of 
my son.  It was January 
22nd of 2011.  My wife 
went into labor in the
wee hours of the morning, 
3am to be exact.  I
remember that I made my
wife a castrol oil shake
in order to induce labor. 
She drank the concoction, very
slowly, as it tasted awful
and laid down to rest.
I told her that I
was going to be downstairs
if she needed me.  I 
played video games and read
a book for a couple
of hours; thinking that we
weren't going to have my
son that night, I decided 
to go to bed, it
was at that moment that
I heard, "Charlie! I think
it's time."  I was instantly 
alert and awake, ready to 
take her to the hospital
and meet my son!  It
was snowing that night, and
as I was driving, I
remember my wife telling me
to slow down, because the
streets were especially slippery, so
I slowed down and we 
actually had a moment where
everything was quiet and serene,
which was a good thing,
because for the next 24 hours, 
things were going to be
very intense.  At this time 
I'll spare you the birth 
scene, as this story is 
supposed to be PG, and 
flash forward to the moment
my son was born.  It  
was an incredible moment. I 
remember looking intently into his 
face and thinking, "well, it's 
nice to meet you." This
was the moment that I 
have been waiting for nine 
months; left wondering what he'll 
look like, because the ultra 
sound pictures didn't help me 
in creating an image of what 
he looked like.  It was 
looking at him in the
flesh, for the first time,
that made me one of 
the luckiest and happiest fathers
in the world.
